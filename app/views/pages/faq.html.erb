				<div class="question">
					Do you sell only sustainable products?&nbsp;&nbsp;<%= render 'layouts/drop_arrows' %>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>No...</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, the sustainability movement hasn't yet gotten to a point where we can demand that every client buys only green and sustainable products. But this a vision we're working toward -- a world where sustainability is the default and everybody everywhere knows how to live in it.</p> 
					<p>So, although we work hard to provide you with sustainable alternatives to not-so-sustainable items, we can supply pretty much whatever your office needs.</p>

				<div class="answer">
					<p>We need clients. Lots of clients. The more money we make, the more buying power we have with our suppliers and with policymakers in Washington.</p>
					<p>To refer a prospective client to us, please email us directly at <a href="mailto:sales@ConsciousOffice.io">sales@ConsciousOffice.io</a>. Thank you in advance!</p>
					<!-- <p>The more we interact with the market, the more we can demand of it.</p> -->
					<p>(Also, stay tuned for updates regarding our political goals in sustainability, and how you can get invovled.)</p>
